# mbacsa-experiments
This a repository for my thesis containing various experiments for the MBACSA framework. The benchmark experiments test the performance of the minting, discharging, revoking and authorizing operations of the [MBACSA Middleware](https://github.com/RubenLauwaert/mbacsa-css) for the Community Solid Server (CSS). These performance expirements use the [MBACSA Client](https://github.com/RubenLauwaert/mbacsa-client) library to make requests to the corresponding CSSs.

## Setting up experiments
The first step for setting up the experiments is to clone the [MBACSA Middleware](https://github.com/RubenLauwaert/mbacsa-css) repository in the rootfolder of this project. This can be done with the following command:

```git clone https://github.com/RubenLauwaert/mbacsa-css```
